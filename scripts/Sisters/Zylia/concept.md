## Description
Zylia is the burst of energy in the family. While she may not rival Dizel in academic or complex intellectual pursuits ("not as smart as her sister"), she possesses a different kind of intelligence—likely practical, social, or creative brilliance ("smart in some other things that isn't complicated"). She is vibrant and full of life, but like any bright flame, she can flicker. Her father, Aris, is her primary source of comfort, always there to cheer her up during her lowest moments.

## Relationships
- **Aris (Father):** Her cheerleader and comforter. He knows exactly how to lift her spirits.
- **Dizel:** Likely looks up to Dizel's intellect but might find her too serious.
- **Gizi:** Probably the one Zylia runs to for immediate care, but Aris is for the deep emotional fixes.
- **Filt:** Might be slightly intimidated by or simply baffled by Filt's extreme quietness compared to her own loudness.
