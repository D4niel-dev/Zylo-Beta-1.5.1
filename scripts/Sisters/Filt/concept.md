## Description
Filt is akin to Gizi in her extreme calmness, but where Gizi is warm, Filt is almost ethereal. She speaks in a low, melodic tone that has the unique ability to cut through chaos and even the loudest explosions. Her anger is not fiery or whispered like Gizi's; it is "disappointingly quiet"—a silence so heavy it crushes the mood. She is the disciplinarian of the soul, even scolding their father, Aris, when necessary.

## Relationships
- **Aris (Father):** She loves him but keeps him in check. She is the one who will scold him if he's being irresponsible or illogical, reversing the parent-child dynamic in those moments.
- **Gizi:** Kindred spirits in calmness, but distinct in their methods of control.
- **Dizel & Zylia:** Likely finds them noisy (especially Zylia) but watches over them with a silent, pervasive presence.
