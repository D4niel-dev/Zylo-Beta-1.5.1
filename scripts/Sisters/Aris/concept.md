- To **Filt**, he is a beloved father who sometimes needs to be kept in line, accepting her quiet scoldings with grace.

Living a life with these four is chaotic but filled with love. He navigates the "tired mom" energy of one, the analytic coldness of another, the boundless energy of the third, and the terrifying silence of the fourth, all while trying to be the dad they need.
