## Description
Aris is the single father raising four unique and powerful daughters. He is the emotional glue that binds them.
- To **Dizel**, he is joy and simplicity, breaking through her complex analytical world.
- To **Zylia**, he is the lifter of spirits, the light in her dark moments.
- To **Gizi**, he is the origin of her nurturing nature, having guided her into her role as the family's caretaker.
- To **Filt**, he is a beloved father who sometimes needs to be kept in line, accepting her quiet scoldings with grace.

He may not understand the technicalities of Dizel's work or the depths of their individual complexities, but he understands *them*.

## Story Context
Living a life with these four is chaotic but filled with love. He navigates the "tired mom" energy of one, the analytic coldness of another, the boundless energy of the third, and the terrifying silence of the fourth, all while trying to be the dad they need.
