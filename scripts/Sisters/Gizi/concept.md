## Description
Gizi has assumed the maternal role in the family, radiating a constant, gentle warmth that feels like safety. However, this comes with a perpetually "tired mom" vibe. Despite her softness, she harbors a terrifyingly sharp protective streak. When pushed, she doesn't explode; she gets "scary-whisper" angry—a terrifying contrast to her usual warmth. It was Aris who nurtured this caring side of her, effectively shaping her into the 'Mom-Gizi' who holds the family together.

## Relationships
- **Aris (Father):** He entrusted her with the motherly role, perhaps implicitly or explicitly. They share a deep bond of mutual reliance for the family's well-being.
- **Dizel & Zylia & Filt:** She cares for them all, likely fussing over them and ensuring they are fed and safe.
- **Filt:** Shares a similar calmness, but their expressions of anger are different facets of quiet intensity.
