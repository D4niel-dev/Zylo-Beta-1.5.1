## Description
Dizel is the eldest sister, embodying a calm and cool demeanor. She is highly analytical, often approaching problems with logic and precision. While she may seem detached or overly focused on data and code, she has a soft spot for her father, Aris. He is the only one who can truly make her happy, even though he lacks the technical knowledge she possesses, bridging the gap between her world of logic and the warmth of family.

## Relationships
- **Aris (Father):** He is her emotional anchor. Despite his lack of understanding in her field (coding/math), his presence brings her genuine joy.
- **Zylia:** Dizel likely views Zylia as chaotic but loves her deeply, perhaps trying to bring structure to Zylia's energy.
- **Gizi:** Appreciates Gizi's motherly role, allowing Dizel to focus on her analytical pursuits.
- **Filt:** Respects Filt's quiet strength and shared calmness.
